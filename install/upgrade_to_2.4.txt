Collec-Science - update procedure to version 2.4.0 from an earlier version

Case 1

    Collec-Science is installed in a dedicated server, which includes both the application and the database
    the database connection account has not been changed from the default configuration
    the application is stored in the /var/www/html/collec-science/xxxx folder, the /var/www/html/collec-science/collec link points to xxxx, and the virtual site (in /etc/apache /sites-available) includes this line: DocumentRoot /var/www/html/collec-science/collec
   Depending on your version, identify the file that corresponds to the update to be applied (the first set of numbers corresponds to your current version):
   - upgrade-1.2-2.4.0.sh
    - upgrade-1.2.3-2.4.0.sh
    - upgrade-2.0-2.4.0.sh
    - upgrade-2.1-2.4.0.sh
    - upgrade-2.2-2.4.0.sh
    - upgrade-2.2.1-2.4.0.sh
    - upgrade-2.2.2-2.4.0.sh
    - upgrade-2.2.3-2.4.0.sh

    Connect to your server, then:
    sudo -s
 Download and run the update script you selected:
 wget https://github.com/Irstea/collec/raw/master/install/script_name
chmod +x script_name
 ./script_name

 The script will download the release and perform the installation.

Case 2

You do not answer exactly case 1, and you are already in version 1.2:

Connect to your server, then:
Step 1 : download the release

 sudo -s

Go to the program installation folder:

 cd /var/www/xxxx

Download the application code:

 wget https://github.com/Irstea/collec/archive/master.zip
 unzip master.zip
 mv collec-master collec-2.4.0

Step 2: Update the database

cd collec-2.4.0/install

If you use schemas that are not "col" and "gacl", also edit the files to put the right values:

    pgsql/col_alter_1.2-1.2-1.2.2.3.sql
    pgsql/col_alter_1.2.2.3-2.0.sql
    pgsql/col_alter_2.0-2.1.1.sql
    pgsql/col_alter_2.1-2.2.2.sql
    pgsql/col_alter_2.2-2.3.3.sql
    pgsql/gacl_alter_2.2-2.3.sql
    pgsql/col_alter_2.3-2.4.sql

Step 2.1: If the database is hosted on the same server:

Depending on the level of your current version, edit the files:

    upgrade-1.2-1.2-1.2.2.3.sql
    upgrade-1.2.2.3-2.0.0.sql
    upgrade-2.0-2.1.1.sql
    upgrade-2.1-2.1-2.2.sql
    upgrade-2.2-2.3.sql
    upgrade-2.3-2.4.sql

and check/adapt the connection settings to the database.

Run the "upgrade" scripts with the command :
su postgres -c "psql -f upgrade-xx-yy.sql"

in order to upgrade your database to the current version

Step 2.2: If the database is hosted on another server:

run each update script, depending on your version, with the command :

psql -h server -U username -W -d database -c "col_alter_xx-yy.sql"

Step 3: Switch to the new version

    Copy the previous version of param/param.inc.php and the encryption keys for the identification tokens:

 cd ../..
 cp old_folder/param/param/param.inc.php collec-2.4.0/param/
 cp old_folder/param/id_collec* collec-2.4.0/param/

    Update rights:

collec-2.4.0/install/apache2/upgrade_rights.sh collec-2.4.0

    delete the symbolic link (if this is the mechanism you used), and recreate it:

 rm collec
 ln -s collec-2.4.0 collec

Case n° 3

Your instance is in a version prior to version 1.2.
This is an adaptation of case 2, you will need to upgrade your database to version 1.2.

Perform step 1 of case 3: the application code is now downloaded
In the folder collec-2.4.0/install/pgsql, you will find all the scripts corresponding to the different updates required.

edit each file to be executed, and check the names of the schemas
run each script until you reach version 1.2, with the following command:

psql -h server -U username -W -d database -c "col_alter_1.1-1.2.2.sql"

to update from version 1.1 to version 1.2

Then carry out steps 2 and 3 of case n°2.
