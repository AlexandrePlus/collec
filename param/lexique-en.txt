collection: a collection is a coherent set of samples about a particular subject. Sample access rights are managed by collection. It is also possible to link a sampling location to a collection.

container type: detailed type of container, specifying the capacity, the storage product or the storage conditions, if any, the associated risks when handling, etc. It can be a site, a building, a room, a cupboard, a shelf, a box, a can, a tube, etc. When creating a container type, it is possible to specify the number of available slots (number of rows or columns), which will contain one and only one object. This is a concept that makes sense for boxes containing multiple tubes, or cabinets for which we do not want to declare the shelves. If nothing is specified, the number of locations is at least 1 (one line, one column, data required for technical reasons).

container: any object that can contain another one. Not to be confused with derivative samples and subsamples.

database and original UID: when entering a sample, if it was created in another database, it is possible to indicate the code of the initial database followed by the assigned identifier. This code will then be used during the searches, which makes it possible to keep the labels already used.

derivative sample: sample created from another, of the same type or not, identified independently. In other words, a sample child of another. For example, a carrot section is a derivative from the half-carrot X, which itself derivatives from the whole carrot.

event type: an event that may occur on a sample or on a container. The event can be external (eg broken container), voluntary (eg analysis) or involuntary (eg lost sample).

family of containers: large category of containers, to facilitate research (room, site, box ...).

identifier type or secondary identifier: it is possible to link various identifiers to an object, for example international codes. The types of identifier allow to describe them. If they are not numeric, these identifiers can also be used in searches or scans for move / removal

latitude and longitude of a container: for a room, a building, a site, etc., WGS84 coordinates in decimal format.

latitude and longitude of a sample: place where the sample was taken. In fact, the geographic point associated with the sample. It can be edited by clicking on the map or on the link "Locate your position!". This action, * if performed in the field *, will trigger the registration of the location of creation / collection of the sample.

location of sampling: the place or site where the sample was taken. The site is in general a way of grouping the samples with respect to a spatial organization of the collection. This notion does not necessarily need precise geo-referencing, but can be used to codify the name of the sample and can help researchers to define how to search / group the samples.

metadata: elements (such as the name of the harvesters, taxon ...) that anyone wants to add to each sample of a collection

object status: allows to indicate if an object (sample or container) is always usable. The statuses can be varied and depend on the local operating mode (broken container, sample which no longer contains exploitable material ...).

operation: an operation can be described as an action that changes the state of a sample. With this software, it results in the creation of a new sample derived from the previous one.

product used, storage product: product used to store the sample (eg ethanol). Sometimes called "storage product" in the documentation.

protocol: protocol used to collect data. A protocol is a series of operations that contribute to producing (or even preserving) samples that can be used for research. This is basically a document that describes the different steps that a sample takes.

sample type: allows to define generic types - by type of container (tube, zip bag ...) with possibility to link a metadata model.

storage condition: main characteristics of the preservation mode (cold, controlled atmosphere, lyophilization ...). Can also be used to describe the pre-treatment of the sample for preservation.

subsample: part of a sample that is not individually identifiable (sample of x material, one of 10 identical scales). In chemistry, can be assimilated to the aliquot.
